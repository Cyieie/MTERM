        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p> Hello, my name is <strong>Cyrus Songodanan</strong>, 21 years old and from Pasig City.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I was born
            on <b>December 18, 2003</b>.<b><sup>2</sup></b> I have so many childhood experiences, such as always playing 
            outside the house and having happy friends who are still with me today.<b><sup>3</sup></b> Being a child is 
            one of the times I would like to go back to because there were no problems to think about, 
            and all we did was play.<b><sup>4</sup></b> We had strict parents, but they were also the reason why my 
            childhood was happy.<b><sup>5</sup></b> My parents always told me as a kid to be more sociable so I could 
            make good friends, and because of that, I met many people, some of whom remain my 
            friends to this day, while others are no longer in my life.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I still remember how my parents 
            would scold me as a kid because I wouldn’t take afternoon naps and would just keep 
            playing outside.<b><sup>7</sup></b> Aside from being scolded, my parents also had a sweet side, like the time 
            they gave me my first guitar, and my older sister taught me how to play it.<b><sup>8</sup></b> This sparked my 
            love for playing the guitar, which I still enjoy today.<b><sup>9</sup></b> It wasn’t just a guitar they gave me; 
            they also gave me a bike.<b><sup>10</sup></b> I remember always biking with my friends at a park near our 
            house.<b><sup>11</sup></b> I really enjoyed my childhood days because I got to try all kinds of sports and 
            activities.<b><sup>12</sup></b> I played basketball, volleyball, and badminton.<b><sup>13</sup></b> These are things I still enjoy doing because I genuinely love these activities.<b><sup>14</sup></b> Christmas is also one of the best parts of 
            my childhood memories because it was the time I saved up a lot of money.<b><sup>15</sup></b> Aside from 
            money, I also received different toys and items from my godparents.<b><sup>16</sup></b> I will never forget all 
            my childhood experiences because they became the foundation of who I am today.<b><sup>17</sup></b></p>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>Of course, my teenage years were also wonderful.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I explored many things about 
            myself.<b><sup>2</sup></b> When I was in grade 9, I started playing the guitar again, but I wasn’t very focused 
            because I had difficulty playing the songs I liked.<b><sup>3</sup></b> However, during the lockdown, things 
            changed.<b><sup>4</sup></b> I was so bored at home and had nothing to do except play online games and 
            attend online classes, so I focused on playing the guitar.<b><sup>5</sup></b> I tried playing a song every day 
            until my fingers got used to handling the guitar.<b><sup>6</sup></b> During that time, I developed a stronger 
            love for singing and playing music.<b><sup>7</sup></b> I also discovered that I could sing, even if just a little.<b><sup>8</sup></b> 
            When I was in grade 11 at UE Manila, I joined the Music Aficionado club, and thanks to 
            them, I learned how to play music even though it was all online.<b><sup>9</sup></b> I often joined their 
            activities to expose my skills and gain the experience I needed to grow.<b><sup>10</sup></b> One of the happiest 
            moments before I joined this club was when they made me play a song I didn’t know.<b><sup>11</sup></b> I 
            spent a week learning it and tried my best to join the club.<b><sup>12</sup></b> All the hard work was worth it 
            because I made it into the music club.<b><sup>13</sup></b> My teenage experience didn’t end there, though.<b><sup>14</sup></b> 
            Before I graduated, we had our prom, and I was one of the performers on stage with my 
            friend.<b><sup>15</sup></b> I became even more passionate about playing music as many of my fellow students 
            sang along with us while we performed, and the feeling was amazing.<b><sup>16</sup></b> With every 
            performance, I learned to become more confident in myself and love the things I do.<b><sup>17</sup></b> 
            With the help of my friends and mentors in Music Aficionado, I became happier expressing 
            myself through music.<b><sup>18</sup></b> I can’t count how many songs I learned in this club, and with each 
            song, I learned to trust my abilities.<b><sup>19</sup></b> In the end, music became my inspiration to keep 
            growing and dreaming, not just in this art but in my life as a whole.<b><sup>20</sup></b></p>

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <p>My college experiences are not that hard yet because I have many friends who help 
            and support me through the challenges of college life.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I know that college isn’t easy, and 
            you need friends who will stand by you through the hard times and the happy ones.<b><sup>2</sup></b> Right 
            now, I have friends who never leave me even when we’re all struggling; we fight together 
            for our future.<b><sup>3</sup></b> My love for music still remains strong during college life.<b><sup>4</sup></b> Since I started 
            college, I joined the UE JAM SESSION, and that’s where I experienced performing on 
            stage with people watching us.<b><sup>5</sup></b> We have a band called 'Da Binsi,' and we have two 
            vocalists, with me playing acoustic guitar.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I didn’t just join a music club in college, but I 
            also became a member of an organization called Comsso, and currently, I’m one of the 
            officers.<b><sup>7</sup></b> I’ve met many upperclassmen because of the clubs, and now they provide ideas 
            and guidance for my upcoming college journey.<b><sup>8</sup></b> They guide me in what I should do and 
            what I shouldn’t.<b><sup>9</sup></b> I feel blessed to be surrounded by people who care about my growth and 
            success.<b><sup>10</sup></b> I also try my best to share the knowledge I’ve gained with others, so we can all 
            help each other.<b><sup>11</sup></b> Despite the pressures of college life, these experiences make it all 
            worthwhile.<b><sup>12</sup></b> I know that the friendships I’ve built and the lessons I’ve learned will shape 
            who I’ll become in the future.<b><sup>13</sup></b> Sometimes, we have late-night talks about our dreams, 
            which make me more motivated to push myself forward.<b><sup>14</sup></b> Even though college can be 
            overwhelming, having my friends and the right support system makes it manageable.<b><sup>15</sup></b> 
            Every new challenge becomes an opportunity to grow, and I’m excited for what lies ahead.<b><sup>16</sup></b> 
            I’m also starting to see the importance of balancing both my academic and personal 
            passions.<b><sup>17</sup></b> The skills I’ve gained in music, along with my academic pursuits, will help me 
            build a future I’ve always dreamed of.<b><sup>18</sup></b> In the end, college isn’t just about the degree; it’s 
            about finding yourself, making lasting memories, and learning how to face life’s 
            challenges with confidence.<b><sup>19</sup></b></p>
